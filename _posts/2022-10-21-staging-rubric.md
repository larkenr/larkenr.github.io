Staging Manila and Littleneck clams based on histology requires a good rubric to compare to samples and establish consistant assessment. In order to establish this rubric for our samples, here are collected a number images illustrating different stages.

| stage 2 |

| ![](https://owl.fish.washington.edu/hesperornis/Larken_clam/L-C-112_4x_b.jpg) | many eggs, medium density, especially along the edge of folicle walls |
| stage 3 |

| ![](https://owl.fish.washington.edu/hesperornis/Larken_clam/L-C-108_4x_b.jpg) | high denisty of eggs, but some connective tissue and deformed eggs |
| stage 4 |
| ![](https://owl.fish.washington.edu/hesperornis/Larken_clam/M-C-012_4x_b.jpg) | low density of eggs, folicle walls breaking down |
| ![](https://owl.fish.washington.edu/hesperornis/Larken_clam/M-C-028_4x.jpg) | lower denisty of eggs, lots of connective tissue between folicles |
| ![](http://owl.fish.washington.edu/hesperornis/Larken_clam/M-C-007_4x_b.jpg) | low numbers of eggs, empty space and connective tissue, maybe spent? |
| ![](https://owl.fish.washington.edu/hesperornis/Larken_clam/M-C-040_4x_a.jpg) | low numbers of eggs, lots of connective tissue, atritic eggs in central portion? |
| stage 5 |
| ![](https://owl.fish.washington.edu/hesperornis/Larken_clam/M-C-041_4x_a.jpg) | very low numbers of eggs |
| ![](https://owl.fish.washington.edu/hesperornis/Larken_clam/L-C-092_4x_a.jpg) | only a couple eggs |
