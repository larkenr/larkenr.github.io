Experiments with the goal of understanding the effects of ocean acidification rely on accurate determination of pH in seawater. There are a number of ways of measuring pH, but one of the most accurate is the use of a spectrometer and a pH sensetive dye. In our experiment, pH was determined initially using a durefet sensor, which is an type of ion sensitive field effect transistor (ISFET). These probes were connected to relays which injected CO<sub>2</sub> when sensed pH was determined to be above the setpoint. Nonetheless, probes can vary in accuracy, and so regular spectrometery was needed to determine the actual pH in treatments and adjust relay setpoints as necessary. 

The system we employed consisted of an Ocean Optics light source, a light attenuator, a sample cell where a cuvetter containing seawater samples were placed in the path of the light, and finally a mini spectrometer. Seawater samples were first loaded in a cylindrical cuvette with no air bubbles, and a baseline absorbance spectrum acquired using the Oceanview program set on absorbance mode. Here is an example baseline spectrum.

After this, 30ul of sample were removed and replaced with an equal volume of the dye m-cresol purple.
