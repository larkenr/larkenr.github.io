All clams not used for dry tissue weight were used in ATPase activity analysis. The data can be found [here](https://github.com/larkenr/Clam-OA-project/blob/main/ATPase%20data%20sheet.csv)

Looking at the data, we can visualize using boxplots, and we see that there is a significant difference between the control treatments in each species, but no difference between the OA and control in either treatment.

Looking at the distribution of data, we see a wider spread for littlenecks in both treatments
