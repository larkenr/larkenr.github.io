Many December goals were comlepeted, but some work is still incomplete in filling in the gaps from the first round data, specifically finishing alkalinity sample analysis and incorporating this data to determine in situ pH. I will also continue to work on creating the transcriptome library, and begin the second round of the clam OA experiment and any remaining prep beforehand.

## Histology ##

- [ ] Continue working with Dorothy on quantitative staging of clam histology

## Clam manuscript ##

- [ ] Complete alkalinity assays

- [ ] Incorporate alkalinity data to find in situ pH

## RNA ##

- [ ] Next steps for littleneck transcript library prep 

## Clam OA 2.0 ##

- [ ] Complete animal care and sampling timeline

- [ ] Collect clams and install in system

- [ ] Time point 0 measurements
